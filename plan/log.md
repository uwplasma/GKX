# Work log

## 2026-08-21 — repository and runtime audit

- Audited `main` at `5f3ab32e`, GitHub PR metadata, branch protection,
  authorship, repository objects, the QA output bundle, saturation logic, plot
  geometry, and movie generator.
- Reproduced the main CI mypy failure and opened PR #81 with a one-line,
  source-line-neutral fix. Local mypy, architecture gate, and 44 plotting tests
  pass.
- Demonstrated that the QA artifact has an impossible saturation window ending
  after the saved trace and that the final state can be later than its label.
- Rejected the proposed `t=50--55` average: only two saved samples, about 24%
  below the later mean, with `Wg` still evolving.
- Identified the 3-D stellarator plot as a synthetic circular torus and the
  terminal heat-flux spectrum as unresolved.
- Rehearsed a source-complete history rewrite. Keeping every original commit and
  all `src/` history while snapshotting auxiliary paths produces a clean
  7.72-MiB pack; current tracked/generated assets prevent a sub-10-MiB result
  without migration.
- Replaced the stale append-only roadmap with current evidence. Old prose and
  patch snapshots remain recoverable in Git history and the pre-rewrite bundle.
- Opened PR #83 to remove the accidentally merged plan from `main`; this PR #82
  remains the branch-only living roadmap and must not be merged.
- Opened PR #84 to make the state, fields, restart, and terminal diagnostic share
  the exact physical-time horizon and to check saturation every 128 steps. Its
  broad nonlinear/runtime/release suite passes; the stopping statistic itself
  is deliberately unchanged pending the replicated validation campaign.
- Recorded an independent pre-existing validation defect: a float32 eager/JIT
  trajectory test demands `rtol=1e-12` although its observed relative difference
  is about `8e-8` on both the PR branch and untouched `main`.
